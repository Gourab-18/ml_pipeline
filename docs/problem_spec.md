# Problem Specification: Customer Churn Prediction

## Executive Summary
We are building a machine learning system to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. The goal is to identify customers likely to cancel their subscription within the next 30 days, enabling proactive retention efforts.

## Problem Definition

### Target Variable
- **Name**: `churn_probability`
- **Type**: Binary classification (0 = will not churn, 1 = will churn)
- **Unit**: Probability score (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Definition**: Customer will cancel their subscription within 30 days of the prediction date

### Prediction Horizon
- **Time Window**: 30 days
- **Prediction Frequency**: Daily batch predictions
- **Action Window**: 7 days (time available to take retention actions)

### Business Context
- **Primary Use Case**: Proactive customer retention
- **Secondary Use Case**: Resource allocation for retention campaigns
- **Business Impact**: 
  - Cost of churn: $500 average customer lifetime value
  - Retention cost: $50 per customer
  - Target: Reduce churn rate from 15% to 10%

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **AUC-ROC**: Target ≥ 0.85
- **Rationale**: Balanced performance across all probability thresholds

### Secondary Metrics
- **Precision@10%**: ≥ 0.40 (precision when predicting top 10% most likely to churn)
- **Recall@10%**: ≥ 0.60 (recall when predicting top 10% most likely to churn)
- **Business Metric**: Retention rate improvement of 5 percentage points

### Model Performance Requirements
- **Inference Latency**: < 100ms per prediction
- **Training Frequency**: Weekly retraining
- **Model Drift Detection**: Monthly monitoring
- **Data Freshness**: Features updated daily

## Data Sources

### Primary Data Sources
1. **Customer Database**: Demographics, subscription details, payment history
2. **Usage Analytics**: Feature usage, session data, engagement metrics
3. **Support Tickets**: Customer service interactions, complaint history
4. **Billing System**: Payment history, billing issues, plan changes
5. **Marketing Campaigns**: Email opens, clicks, campaign responses

### Data Volume
- **Training Set**: ~500K customers (12 months historical data)
- **Daily Updates**: ~2K new customers, ~50K feature updates
- **Prediction Set**: ~100K active customers daily

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance required
- **Real-time Requirements**: Batch processing acceptable
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based deployment preferred
- **Model Size**: < 1GB for deployment efficiency

### Business Constraints
- **Regulatory**: Financial services compliance
- **Budget**: $50K annual ML infrastructure budget
- **Timeline**: MVP in 3 months, full system in 6 months
- **Stakeholders**: Product, Engineering, Customer Success teams

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Missing or corrupted customer records
2. **Concept Drift**: Customer behavior changes over time
3. **Privacy Violations**: Unauthorized use of personal data
4. **Model Bias**: Unfair treatment of customer segments
5. **System Failures**: Prediction service downtime

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Validation**: Automated quality checks and alerts
2. **Model Monitoring**: Drift detection and retraining triggers
3. **Privacy Controls**: Data anonymization and access controls
4. **Bias Testing**: Regular fairness audits and bias mitigation
5. **Redundancy**: Backup systems and graceful degradation

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] AUC-ROC ≥ 0.85 on holdout test set
- [ ] Model inference < 100ms per prediction
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for prediction service
- [ ] Automated retraining pipeline operational

### Business Success
